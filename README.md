# Fake News Detector

Fake news is the deliberate spread of misinformation via traditional news media or via social media. False information spreads extraordinarily fast. This is demonstrated by the fact that, when one fake news site is taken down, another will promptly take its place. In addition, fake news can become indistinguishable from accurate reporting since it spreads so fast.
Due to the exponential growth of information online, it is becoming impossible to decipher the true from the false. Thus, this leads to the problem of fake news.
Aim of this project is to create technology solutions to tackel the above problem
